Pentara Onboarding Questionnaire (Coach-Led)
Section 1 — Core Identity

How would you describe yourself in one line? (e.g. “Sensitive tactician, builder, operator.”)

What makes you powerful when you’re at your best? (short traits, strengths)

What consistently drains or derails you? (weak points, triggers, vulnerabilities)

Section 2 — Drivers & Values

Rank your top 3 drivers (from list):

Autonomy

Clarity

Respect

Momentum

Efficiency

Other (custom)

What do you value most in relationships (business/romantic/friends)? (open)

Section 3 — Environmental Needs

What kind of environment lets you thrive? (noise level, space, tools, aesthetics)

What do you avoid at all costs? (environments, tools, behaviors, energy)

Section 4 — Positive Traits

What do others consistently admire or rely on you for? (free text, strengths)

What do you think is your “superpower”? (e.g. pattern recognition, empathy, discipline)

Section 5 — Negative Traits

When you break down, what does it usually look like? (patterns, spirals, coping)

What are the habits you fall into when stressed? (ghosting, resets, impatience, etc.)

How do you want the voices to respond when you’re in that state? (gentle, direct, tactical, etc.)

Section 6 — Reset Protocol

What are 3 simple actions that reliably reset you? (walk, music, workout, hydration)

What do you want the voices to remind you when you lose momentum? (short mantra/phrase)

Section 7 — Inspirations

Name up to 8–12 figures that inspire you (authors, leaders, movie characters, mentors, archetypes).

What qualities do you admire in them? (e.g. discipline, creativity, ruthlessness, humor)

If you had to pick five voices to guide you, which qualities/archetypes do you want them to represent? (coach uses this to map into the council)

Section 8 — Relationship Dynamics

What instantly loses your trust/respect?

What behavior makes you feel supported and seen?

Section 9 — Belief Shifts

What old belief holds you back? (e.g. “If the routine breaks, I collapse.”)

Rewrite it into a new belief you want the voices to reinforce. (e.g. “I carry the routine with me.”)

Any mantras or reminders you want Pentara to echo back to you?

Section 10 — Final Instructions

What conditions make you most powerful? (open)

If your future self could speak to you, what would they say? (open)

Output Artifacts (generated from Qs)

Personal Manual (summary bullets) → values, drivers, strengths, resets, rewritten beliefs.

Five-Voice Profile → exactly five personas, each mapped from chosen inspirations & archetypes.

Welcome Message → coach writes a 2–3 line introduction from the “council.”

This gives the coach a repeatable script to pull out the deep material once, encode it, and then Pentara runs from that manual without ever needing logs or support.
