# Pentara Strategic Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Onboarding & Council Formation (Weeks 1-4)

### Pentara Onboarding Interview and Council Formation
**Purpose**: To create a personalized user manual and SWOT, then form a tailored council with dynamic archetype selection/swaps.

#### Interview Questions (10-15 Minutes)
- **Strengths**: What are you naturally great at in your work or personal life? (e.g., creativity, leadership)
- **Weaknesses**: What challenges or blind spots do you face? (e.g., procrastination, risk aversion)
- **Opportunities**: What goals or trends are you excited to pursue? (e.g., career pivot, new market)
- **Threats**: What external risks worry you? (e.g., competition, economic shifts)
- **User Manual**: What type of advice resonates most? (e.g., inspirational, tactical) Who inspires your decisions? (e.g., specific thought leaders)
- **Preferences**: How do you prefer to receive guidance? (e.g., direct, reflective, data-driven)

#### AI Processing Logic
1. **Input Analysis**: Parse responses using LLM (e.g., Grok) to extract key themes and map to archetype traits
2. **Initial Council Formation**: Assign five archetypes based on SWOT and user manual
3. **Swap Mechanic**: If archetype traits mismatch user needs, simulate council discussion and propose replacements

#### Sample Output (First Decree)
**User Input**: Strengths (sales), Weaknesses (organization), Opportunities (new market), Threats (competitors), User Manual (prefers direct, Horowitz-style advice).

**Council**: Sage, Warrior, Strategist, Visionary, Executor (swapped for Healer).

**Decree**: "Leverage your sales strength to enter the new market swiftly (Visionary), but implement a CRM system to address organization gaps (Strategist). Monitor competitors closely (Warrior) and seek mentorship to refine your approach (Sage). Prioritize actionable steps over emotional reflection (Executor)."

## Phase 2: Follow-Up Session System (Weeks 5-8)

### Pentara Follow-Up Session (Proprietary Data Protection)
**Purpose**: Deliver personalized council realignment and decrees without exposing user logs, using server-side AI processing and dynamic archetype swaps.

#### Session Structure (30 Minutes, $99–149)

**Check-In (5-7 Minutes)**:
- Questions to update user manual/SWOT (via app/portal)
- What's changed in your goals or challenges since last session?
- What type of advice has been most/least helpful?
- Any new inspirations or role models?

**Council Realignment (10 Minutes)**:
- AI prompt: "Analyze user ID [X]'s encrypted profile and new check-in data. Evaluate archetype fit; propose swaps if fit score < 70%."
- Output: Narrative of council debate and swap rationale, delivered as ritualized script

**Unified Decree (10 Minutes)**:
- AI synthesizes updated council's insights into single directive
- Wrap-Up: User receives "Realignment Summary" via email/portal

#### Technical Implementation
- **Data**: Encrypted database (AWS RDS, AES-256). Access restricted to AI layer
- **AI**: Grok or GPT-4o via API, with secure prompts
- **Security**: GDPR/CCPA-compliant; regular audits
- **Scalability**: Fully automated, with optional human facilitators
